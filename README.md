# Shirleys-Sumerian-Translation-Attempt
The Sumerian Translation Attempt: to collate all existing corpuses and train a model sufficiently competent at Sumerian-English translation. 

- currently collating and parsing existing corpuses in order to create a singular database. Not yet started on creating the translation pipeline
- there have only been two attempts so far in the literature for machine translation of Sumerian and the results have not been promising
- old school solutions like Moses and dictionary-based parsing should work
