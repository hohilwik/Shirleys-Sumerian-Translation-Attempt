# Changelog

## 001
- currently collating and parsing existing corpuses in order to create a singular database. Not yet started on creating the translation pipeline
- there have only been two attempts so far in the literature for machine translation of Sumerian and the results have not been promising
- old school solutions like Moses and rule-based grammar dictionary-based parsing should work

## 002
- CDLI data is not cleaned properly. Need to write a custom parser that can deal with that. Will also attempt the suggested method using APIs
- collating grammar notes for rule-based translation based on books in Readings folder
- The lack of consistency in hyphenating words in transliterations is going to present a problem
